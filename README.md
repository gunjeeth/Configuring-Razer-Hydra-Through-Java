Configuring-Razer-Hydra-Through-Java
====================================

Razer Hydra is a gaming motion-sensing controller that gives enough freedom to users during game play through lesser body movement restrictions. The device consists of two controllers one for each hand with gamepad type buttons and a base station which makes use of magnetic motion sensing for more accurate position feedback in the 3D space.

This is a sample program that determines the position of the controllers.
